# PRAISE + PROVISIONS

401 Midterm project by Tre Cain, Jamilah McWilliams, Jimmy Nguyen, Brian Nelson, Christina Gislason

Project: Praise + Provisions

## DESCRIPTION 

Our team created an application that allows users to search top restaurants in any U.S. city and additionally receive recommendations from top celebrity chefs. 

## FRONT END WEB APP

Users login by entering their name to create a profile after which point they are directed to a search page where they can input a U.S. city to search for the top-ten rated restaurants for that given city. On the results page, the top restaurants are listed in order of popularity. If any of these listings also happen to be a celebrity recommendation, then the chef's image is shown next to that restaurant along with that chef's review for that particular restaurant. Additionally, on the results page, a user will be able to save their choice of restaurants to a 'MyFavorites' page. This information persists throughout the site and so long as the user returns under the same user profile. Lastly, an 'AboutUs' page provides some basic information each individual developer with links to their GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

## COMMUNICATION PLAN

Our team has agreed that we would limit working on the project to school hours, however, we ended up staying beyond class hours to stay on track. Team members that continued to work on the project outside of the school setting worked on their individual branches and merged only after the team reviewed the work the following morning. Outside of class hours, we communicated via Slack. After any proposals or questions were posed, we opened up the floor for discussions. 

## CONFLICT PLAN

We tried to avoid having members from inadequately contributing to the project by cultivating an open dialogue and assigning work corporately. We tried to resolve conflicts by opening up discussions and assessing if there is actually a conflict as opposed to there having been a misunderstanding. We agreed to escalate conflicts to discuss with instructor/TAs to mediate should there be any unsuccessful attempts to manage conflicts internally or if an individual is not receptive to team suggestions or concerns. 

## WORK PLAN

We worked on project tasks by itemizing “to-dos” on the VSTS project management tool. We worked through a combination of individual, pair, and mob programming. Throughout project week, we alternated between partners so each team member had some opportunity to learn from their peers and continue to experience the dynamics of working within a team of unique individuals. We tried to track each team member to ensure equal contribution to the project by checking  GitHub analytics to assess distribution of work. 

## GIT PROCESS

Our Git Flow required each team member to check out new branches daily. In order to avoid any merge conflicts, our team worked on beta branches before merging to master and clearly communicate once a pull request has been merged. Everyone will pull master immediately following this. We required one or two individuals to review a PR. The PRs were merged by someone other than the individual or group that wrote the code. We merged frequently. Throughout project week, we sat either together, or within close proximity to each other for ease of communication.  

## SAMPLE OF WEB APP



## WEBAPP DATABASE SCHEMA

There are two tables and one join table. The Profile table contains all of the user profiles and their properties while the Restaurants table contains the same for restaurants. The join table represents the many to many relationship between the two tables.

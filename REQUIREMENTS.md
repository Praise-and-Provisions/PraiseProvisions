## Vision
_What is the vision of this product?_ </br>
The vision of this product is that as a user I want to search for top restaurant listings based on a city that I specify so that I can be informed on the best restaurants that that city has to offer. I want a curated experience that most applications haven't been able to deliver. As a user I want to be able to create a logn in, view results of my search and save restaurant recommendations to a list.  

_What painpoints does this product solve?_ </br>
As a user I want the curated experience to include celelbrity chef and/or noteworthy culinary expert restaurant recommendations. I don't want to have to search multiple sites to compare and compile this information for my culinary adventures.
